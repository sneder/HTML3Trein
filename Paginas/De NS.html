            Nederlandse Spoorwegen (English: "Dutch Railways") is the principal passenger railway operator in the Netherlands. NS provides rail services on the Dutch main rail network (hoofdrailnet). The rail infrastructure is maintained by network
            manager ProRail, which was split off from NS in 2003. Freight services, formerly operated by NS Cargo, merged
            with the DB Schenker group in 2000.

            NS runs 4,800 scheduled domestic trains a day, serving 1.1 million passengers.Also, NS provides international rail services
            from the Netherlands to other European destinations and carries out concessions on some foreign rail markets
            through its subsidiary Abellio.
